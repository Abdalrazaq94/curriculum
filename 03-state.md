# Program State (3 weeks)


> This module and the next are more-or-less a stretched out version of the old JS 2.  In this module the learning objectives are working with data structures, problem solving strategies, debugging strategies & the debugger, dom manipulation, and simple web pages with a "state" object (but not yet oop or DOM components, just functions that act on state and modify DOM directly).


yups.

__Pains & Gains__
* _pains you’ll relieve_: storing data in a ```state``` object makes much more interesting sites, dom components make for a more interesting user experience
* _what you can build_: simple web pages that take user input, process it with page state, and more complex user output with some dom manipulation
* _pains you’ll feel_: your JS is scattered and doesn't feel "whole", having a static page structure is limiting

__Learning Objectives__
* forms for inputting more interesting data
* techniques for designing and debugging your functions
* (nope) pure, vanilla dom components for rendering data structures
* a state object (with no methods)
* more challenging pure functions that operate on user inputs and the state object
* Using the DOM to create basic interactive UI's


__Tech-Specs__
* JS: array methods, array/object manipulation,
* DOM: click listeners, basic input & output, manipulations
* DevTools: debugger
