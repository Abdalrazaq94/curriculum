## FullStacking

> 4 weeks.

> This module takes the place of the old Node.js module but with a few changes:
> * The first week will be a review of JS basics & algorithms, as well as an introduction to programming in Node (ie. modules, modules, native APIs like assert & fs, ...).  This gives a chance to get accustomed to debugging in VSC instead of the browser, to ease into "pure" programming without the immediate feedback of DOM-based apps, and to internalize that Node is at it's heart just another JS environment with a couple super powers (being a server and reading/writing files).
> * The fourth week's project will be an mvp fullstack app with a restful API reading and writing from JSON files, and a minimal React frontend. Both served from the same endpoint
> * Minimal deployment of the fourth week project with something like heroku





__Pains & Gains__
* _pains you’ll relieve_: your projects will now have a much richer user experience due to _persistent_ data between refreshes
* _what you can build_: very simple fullstack webapp with a react frontend & restful express backend that reads and writes from a JSON file, deployed with a cloud-based hosting service.
* _pains you’ll feel_: building your app on top of data stored in a .json file is very limited and not robust.

Learning Objectives
* basic fs read/write for persisting state as json
* comfort debugging with VSC devtools
* restful API's
* understanding the relationship between a front and back end
* cloud-based deployment options


Tech Specs
* Native Node.js: require, module.export, fs, assert
* Servers & APIs: express, static serving, body-parser, cors
* A cloud deployment platform
