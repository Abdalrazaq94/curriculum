# Encapsulation (3 weeks)


> This module is the "second half" of the old JS 2.  In this module the goal is learning how to take projects like the ones from the last module and organizing the code into complete app objects with state, methods that act on state, and render functions.  (but not yet classes & inheritance, just object literals)

practical javascript
weeks 2 & 3 projects from class 6

__Pains & Gains__
* _pains you’ll relieve_: Your projects were starting to become quite scattered, and it wasn't easy to keep track of how and where different pieces were interacting.
* _what you can build_: a fully interactive app object with state, methods, handlers, and render functions
* _pains you’ll feel_: Apps built around a single object containing only hard-coded and user data are limited

Learning Objectives
* simple oop apps with handlers for inputs and renders for output
* fully-rendered ui's (ie. start with only a root) & DOM components
* behavioral testing / tdd
* correctly using 'this' to access values in objects

Tech-Specs:
* Vanilla JS: DOM components, objects, event listeners
