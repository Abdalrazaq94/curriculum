## Working With Code

> 1 Week.

> This module is completely new.  It's a week for students to orient themselves with the workflows they'll need: working on their computers, setting up their directory structure, installing softwares, using github, and getting a handle of the HYF Be homework processes so they can begin the first module in less of a daze.


As your first introduction to programming this module's main objective is to get you comfortable with the workflows of programming, and of Hack Your Future BE in particular.  The finished project won't be complex or impressive to the casual observer, but in order for you to complete it you will need to have a basic overview of the entire development process.  Including: ideation, local development and testing, pushing and pulling to github, and hosting static web pages.


__Summary__
* _pains you’ll relieve_: disorganized file systems, how/where to edit files, sharing files, making public sites
* _what you can build_: a live portfolio site written using markdown, deployed on GitHub Pages.
* _pains you’ll feel_: your portfolio is very limited being written in markdown, it's easy to get lost in the process of building even a small project

__Learning Objectives__
* push, pull, fork, pr, branch with plain markdown files
* set up github pages
* work locally using VSC & GitKraken (or another client)
* learn how to turn in homework and integrate feedback using issues
* source code vs. interpreted live website (md preview in vsc)

__Tech-Specs__
* _Visual Studio Code_:
* _Dev Browsers_: Firefox, Chromium, Brave, Opera, ...
* _GitKraken_:
* _GitHub_: Wikis, project boards, issues, pull requests
* _MarkDown_: preview in vsc
