## Incremental Development

Find the the main Module repository [right here](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/incremental-development/)

> 3 weeks.

> This module is almost the old HTML/CSS module, but with less of an emphasis on responsive design and less depth in CSS.  In it's place there is more of a focus on managing code with git/github and breaking larger projects into small steps.

> Students will be asked to use folders (instead of branches for now) to demonstrate that they built their projects in fully-working steps. [here's an example from class-6](https://github.com/ChuikinaMaria/HTML-CSS-GitHub/tree/master/homework/week-2-project)


Markdown is great but it's definitely limited, it's meant for writing documents not creating beautiful web pages!  Enter: HTML & CSS.  With just these web technologies you can already make some truly beautiful and interested web pages.  Along with this increased greatness you'll also find it becomes trickier and trickier to keep your work organized, fix your mistakes, and know how far you are through your project.

This is where _Incremental Development_ comes in.  Aside from HTML & CSS, the main skill you will encounter in this module is how to break a large project into small steps that build on top of each other.  You'll learn how, with a little extra discipline,  moving one little step at a time can magically make large projects understandable, and make fixing your mistakes much easier.


__Summary__
* _pains you’ll relieve_: HTML/CSS are much more expressive than MarkDown, but also more complicated. incremental development helps organize your work over time
* _what you can build_: responsive & static web pages, built in steps
* _pains you’ll feel_: HTML/CSS alone don't allow for much interaction, saving your steps in different folders is cumbersome

__Learning Objectives__
* create simple & responsive HTML/CSS sites deployed to gh-pages
* use the devtools to inspect pages, modify live pages, and (loosely) replicate the styling of other web pages
* incremental, story/feature based development using one folder per step


__Tech-Specs__
* HTML5: go into more detail
* CSS3: go into more detail
* Devtools Inspector
* liveServer
