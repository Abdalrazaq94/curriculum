## Data Modeling (2 weeks)


> This module is one week shorter than the previous databases, and that should not impact students' preparedness for the final project:
> * In past DB modules, a good chunk of time was spent still getting used to node/express.  So one week from DB's has been moved to the previous module so students enter DB's prepared to focus on data bases.
> * In past DB modules, it has taken at least a week before all students' machines are set up locally with MySQL.  This module will use a cloud-hosted option (or much simpler local option) instead of MySQL Workbench.  This should also save time and leave more attention to focus on DB's
> * HYF is already short compared to the amount of material we expect students to learn, and as the rest of the curriculum is about programming rather than DB management it makes sense to narrow the focus of this module.  By focusing more on modeling data, writing queries, and using DB interface libraries (instead of setting up, hosting and managing them) the learning objectives can be more concise and specific to the needs of a junior web developer.


__Pains & Gains__
* _pains you’ll relieve_: .json files are tedious and not so robust
* _what you can build_: like before, but with much more interesting data and real data bases
* _pains you’ll feel_: a real itch for a real project




Tech Specs
* SQL
