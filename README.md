# HYF Be

> A few notes about this document as it's still in prototype phase.

> * All of this is still up for discussion.  It represents a best-effort to take into account all of the feedback and ideas we've gathered from coaches, students and alumni over the last year. But it's surely not there yet.  If we've left out some good ideas, if you think we're taking a step backwards with some of these changes, or if you have any ideas to build on what is in this book, please let us know!  Issues, pull requests, slack, it all works.

> * Module names have been changed to be technology agnostic, reflecting the skill, concept or project type students will encounter rather than highlighting the tools used to execute those skills. This is also nice for future-proofing as technologies & frameworks change (mostly applies to the React module).

> * The three biggest changes from the old curriculum are: to add one more module using only vanilla JS in the beginning, to move React before the Node & Data Bases equivalent, and to shorten the React module by 2 weeks.  These changes and more are described with more detail in each module's page

> * There are no links to repositories yet because the new repositories don't exist yet.  After this overview has reached a consensus we can begin preparing the first modules for when class starts in January, and can finalize the later modules on a just-in-time basis to incorporate lessons learned along the way.



Welcome to HYF and congratulations on taking your first step!

Each module is built around a set of skills necessary to do a thing. In each module you'll learn a little bit of a lot of things, pulling together into the skill set needed to build and deploy a project.  Very simple projects at first, but building on each other from module to module until by the end, you are comfortable building and deploying your own fullstack app!

As you work your way through Hack Your Future BE, you'll never fully be comfortable with the skills and technologies you are using.  That is normal!  There is a lot of material to learn, and none of it is easy.  This course is designed to help you gain confidence in the face of this uncertainty.   Even your coaches, experienced professional developers, are always learning always uncertain and always building working apps with technologies they don't fully understand.

What's more important than mastering any particular skill, JS language feature, or development tool is learning to plan and build projects from start to finish.  You can always learn the specific skills & technologies you need when you need them, but if you don't know how to put together a project you can't even make it that far!

In each module description you'll find an overview of what you can expect to learn in that module and a link to that module's repository.  The descriptions will each cover these points:

__Summary__
* _pains you’ll relieve_: How the learning objectives in this module help to overcome challenges encountered in the last module
* _what you can build_: A brief description of the projects you can build after this module. These descriptions are about the scope of the project and how it is designed rather than what it does.
* _pains you’ll feel_: Some of the most glaring limitations and annoyances you'll encounter building this module's projects. (a cliffhanging for the next module)

__Learning Objectives__
* a list of skills you will learn through this module
* and competencies you will have after completing it

__Tech-Specs__
* the technologies and JS language features
* you can expect to explore in this module
* (not a complete list, just a few of the key ones)
