Be\n\nA few notes about this document as it's still in prototype phase.\n\nAll of this is still up for discussion.  It represents a best-effort to take into account all of the feedback and ideas we've gathered from coaches, students and alumni over the last year. But it's surely not there yet.  If we've left out some good ideas, if you think we're taking a step backwards with some of these changes, or if you have any ideas to build on what is in this book, please let us know!  Issues, pull requests, slack, it all works.\n\nModule names have been changed to be technology agnostic, reflecting the skill, concept or project type students will encounter rather than highlighting the tools used to execute those skills. This is also nice for future-proofing as technologies & frameworks change (mostly applies to the React module).\n\nThe three biggest changes from the old curriculum are: to add one more module using only vanilla JS in the beginning, to move React before the Node & Data Bases equivalent, and to shorten the React module by 2 weeks.  These changes and more are described with more detail in each module's page\n\nThere are no links to repositories yet because the new repositories don't exist yet.  After this overview has reached a consensus we can begin preparing the first modules for when class starts in January, and can finalize the later modules on a just-in-time basis to incorporate lessons learned along the way.\n\n\n\nWelcome to HYF and congratulations on taking your first step!\nEach module is built around a set of skills necessary to do a thing. In each module you'll learn a little bit of a lot of things, pulling together into the skill set needed to build and deploy a project.  Very simple projects at first, but building on each other from module to module until by the end, you are comfortable building and deploying your own fullstack app!\nAs you work your way through Hack Your Future BE, you'll never fully be comfortable with the skills and technologies you are using.  That is normal!  There is a lot of material to learn, and none of it is easy.  This course is designed to help you gain confidence in the face of this uncertainty.   Even your coaches, experienced professional developers, are always learning always uncertain and always building working apps with technologies they don't fully understand.\nWhat's more important than mastering any particular skill, JS language feature, or development tool is learning to plan and build projects from start to finish.  You can always learn the specific skills & technologies you need when you need them, but if you don't know how to put together a project you can't even make it that far!\nIn each module description you'll find an overview of what you can expect to learn in that module and a link to that module's repository.  The descriptions will each cover these points:\nSummary\n\npains you’ll relieve: How the learning objectives in this module help to overcome challenges encountered in the last module\nwhat you can build: A brief description of the projects you can build after this module. These descriptions are about the scope of the project and how it is designed rather than what it does.\npains you’ll feel: Some of the most glaring limitations and annoyances you'll encounter building this module's projects. (a cliffhanging for the next module)\n\nLearning Objectives\n\na list of skills you will learn through this module\nand competencies you will have after completing it\n\nTech-Specs\n\nthe technologies and JS language features\nyou can expect to explore in this module\n(not a complete list, just a few of the key ones)\n\n\n\n\n"},"application-process.html":{"url":"application-process.html","title":"Application Process","keywords":"","body":"Application Process\nput in some words\nand a link to the applicaiton procedure once it's on github, or at least when & how & who to access for applying\n\n\n\n"},"precourse.html":{"url":"precourse.html","title":"Precourse","keywords":"","body":"Precourse\nWhat we expect you to do before arriving.\nlink to precourse on github.\nwill we be checking this / asking them to submit it? or just honor system\nprecourse\nstudent handbook\n\n\n\n"},"00-working-with-code.html":{"url":"00-working-with-code.html","title":"0.

It's a week for students to orient themselves with the workflows they'll need: working on their computers, setting up their directory structure, installing softwares, using github, and getting a handle of the HYF Be homework processes so they can begin the first module in less of a daze.\n\nAs your first introduction to programming this module's main objective is to get you comfortable with the workflows of programming, and of Hack Your Future BE in particular.  The finished project won't be complex or impressive to the casual observer, but in order for you to complete it you will need to have a basic overview of the entire development process.  Including: ideation, local development and testing, pushing and pulling to github, and hosting static web pages.\nSummary\n\npains you’ll relieve: disorganized file systems, how/where to edit files, sharing files, making public sites\nwhat you can build: a live portfolio site written using markdown, deployed on GitHub Pages.\npains you’ll feel: your portfolio is very limited being written in markdown, it's easy to get lost in the process of building even a small project\n\nLearning Objectives\n\npush, pull, fork, pr, branch with plain markdown files\nset up github pages\nwork locally using VSC & GitKraken (or another client)\nlearn how to turn in homework and integrate feedback using issues\nsource code vs. interpreted live website (md preview in vsc)\n\nTech-Specs\n\nVisual Studio Code:\nDev Browsers: Firefox, Chromium, Brave, Opera, ...\nGitKraken:\nGitHub: Wikis, project boards, issues, pull requests\nMarkDown: preview in vsc\n\n\n\n\n"},"01-incremental-development.html":{"url":"01-incremental-development.html","title":"1.

Enter: HTML & CSS.  With just these web technologies you can already make some truly beautiful and interested web pages.  Along with this increased greatness you'll also find it becomes trickier and trickier to keep your work organized, fix your mistakes, and know how far you are through your project.\nThis is where Incremental Development comes in.  Aside from HTML & CSS, the main skill you will encounter in this module is how to break a large project into small steps that build on top of each other.

This should also help make the 3 weeks be nearly as effective as the 5 before\nBy moving React before Node & Data Bases, those modules can now be turned into light fullstack modules with simple React frontends to consume the API's they build.

This gives a chance to get accustomed to debugging in VSC instead of the browser, to ease into \"pure\" programming without the immediate feedback of DOM-based apps, and to internalize that Node is at it's heart just another JS environment with a couple super powers (being a server and reading/writing files).\nThe fourth week's project will be an mvp fullstack app with a restful API reading and writing from JSON files, and a minimal React frontend.

This module will use a cloud-hosted option (or much simpler local option) instead of MySQL Workbench.  This should also save time and leave more attention to focus on DB's\nHYF is already short compared to the amount of material we expect students to learn, and as the rest of the curriculum is about programming rather than DB management it makes sense to narrow the focus of this module.
