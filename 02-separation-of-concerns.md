Enter: JavaScript!  Up till now, your web pages didn't really _do_ anything (except be beautiful :).

JavaScript is the programming language for turning your projects from pretty pages to interactive web sites.  But wait!  What's happening behind the screen is even more important than what the user sees!  Before hacking your way into cool projects, take some time to understand Separation of Concerns.

__Separation of Concerns__ means that each piece of code has one simple and well defined task, that multiple pieces of code don't do the same thing, and that your files of code are well-organized according to their task.

Learning this principle early on in your programming career will help you to learn new techniques and frameworks, to test your code testing, to plan your projects, to collaborate, to debug, ... everything!

In our experience, understanding separation of concerns is the most important thing a new programmer can learn. Far more important than learning new libraries, powerful devtools, hip frameworks, or even learning to solve difficult coding challenges.

### Pains & Gains

* Adding JavaScript into your sites will make them much more complicated.  Complexity is the eternal nemesis of software development!  Mastering _Separation of Concerns_ will earn you your white belt in conquering complexity.
* HTML & CSS are quite visual technologies, with a little help from the inspector it's possible to have a nearly-complete understanding of what's going on.  JavaScript is quite different!  While HTML & CSS control what you _see_ on the page, JavaScript controls what you can't see -> _data stored in memory_. Learning to visualize program memory and learning a _notional machine_ for how JavaScript steps through your programs are the ground-works for effective programming, problem solving, and debugging.
* It's nice to build sites that look nice, but at some point you'll want to build projects that _do_ something as well.  Using _prompt_, _alert_, _event listeners_ and _handler functions_ you'll learn how to create user interfaces for your core JS logic functions.

### What you can Build

Beautiful, accessible, responsive web pages that accept user input, process it with your JS functions, and display the result for the user.

### New Frontiers

It won't take long before users are bored of typing in numbers or sentences and getting new numbers or sentences in a pop-up.  Your next-level web pages will have saved data that users interact with over time, and have dynamic user interfaces that update to reflect changes in ...
