## Separation of Concerns

> 3 weeks.

> This module is basically the old JS 1.  In this module the focus will be getting familiar with the JS langauge basics, calling JS functions from HTML interfaces (prompt/alert & basic DOM input/output), and organizing their code in growing projects.

Enter: JavaScript!  Up till now, your web pages didn't really _do_ anything (except be beautiful :).  JavaScript is the programming language for turning your pages from pretty sites to web apps.  Before learning about what exactly is a web app, it's important to first master the fundamentals of JS in isolation (ie. not part of a web page), and to learn how you can connect your JS logic to your web pages in a clean, modular and testable way.

_Separation of Concerns_ is one of the most fundamental principles of any type of software development ... pull from jl 3-layer handlers.

__Summary__
* _pains you’ll relieve_: using Git branches makes incremental development much nicer than lots of folders, javascript puts some interactivity behind your sites.
* _what you can build_: simple web pages, built in steps, with the ability to display processed user input
* _pains you’ll feel_: the user interface is very static and limited, pages that don't remember data are very limited

__Learning Objectives__
* use JS to make stateless web pages (pure functions connected to inputs/outputs in the dom)
* isolating logic from view and testing it
* branches and commits to organize incremental development
* JS/debugger/testing foundations


__Tech-Specs__
* JavaScript: variables, functions, control flow, primitive types
* Browser Interactions: prompt & alert
* DOM: click event listeners
* Git: branches
* Devtools: reading source
* JS Tutor: the best way to ever learn javascript
* Parsonzier: practice your JS problem solving without your syntax errors
