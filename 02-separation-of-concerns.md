## Separation of Concerns

> 3 weeks.

> This module is basically the old JS 1.  In this module the focus will be getting familiar with the JS langauge basics, calling JS functions from HTML interfaces (prompt/alert & basic DOM input/output), and organizing their code in growing projects.

Enter: JavaScript!  Up till now, your web pages didn't really _do_ anything (except be beautiful :).  JavaScript is the programming language for turning your pages from pretty sites to web apps.  Before learning about what exactly is a web app, it's important to first master the fundamentals of JS in isolation (ie. not part of a web page), and to learn how you can connect your JS logic to your web pages in a clean, modular and testable way.

"Separation of concerns" means that each piece of code has one simple and well defined purpose, and that only one piece of code is used for each role.

Understanding this principle will help with testing, development scheduling, collaboration, maintenance, ... everything. In our experience, understanding separation of concerns is the most important thing a new programmer can learn (after mastering JS of course). Far more important than learning new libraries, powerful devtools, or even being good at solving programming challenges.


__Pains & Gains__
* _pains you’ll relieve_: using Git branches makes incremental development much nicer than lots of folders, javascript puts some interactivity behind your sites.
* _what you can build_: simple web pages, built in steps, with the ability to display processed user input
* _pains you’ll feel_: the user interface is very static and limited, pages that don't remember data are very limited

__Learning Objectives__
* use JS to make stateless web pages (pure functions connected to inputs/outputs in the dom)
* isolating logic from view and testing it
* branches and commits to organize incremental development
* JS/debugger/testing foundations


__Tech-Specs__
* JavaScript: variables, functions, control flow, primitive types
* Browser Interactions: prompt & alert
* DOM: click event listeners
* Git: branches
* Devtools: reading source
* JS Tutor: the best way to ever learn javascript
* Parsonzier: practice your JS problem solving without your syntax errors
